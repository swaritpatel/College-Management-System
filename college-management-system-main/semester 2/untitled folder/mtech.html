    <p>International variations
        Australia
        In Australia, the Master of Engineering degree is a research degree requiring completion of a thesis. Like the Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.), it is considered a lesser degree than Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). It is not to be confused with Master of Engineering Science, Master of Engineering Studies or Master of Professional Engineering which are coursework master's degrees. Exceptions are Monash University which awards a Master of Engineering Science by either research or coursework, the University of Melbourne which offers a Master of Engineering by coursework,[1] and the University of Tasmania which offer a Master of Engineering Science by research.[2]
        
        The University of Melbourne accepted the first intake of Master of Engineering students in February 2010. The coursework Master of Engineering is offered in 11 specialisations and accepts graduates with three-year degrees in Science and Maths.
        
        The entry requirement is completion of a bachelor's degree at or above the second class honours level. Some universities do not offer direct enrolment into Doctor of Philosophy degree and students must first enrol in a lesser research degree before "upgrading".
        
        Brazil
        In Brazil, the rough equivalent of a Master of Engineering degree is a professional master's degree of typically two years' length. It involves mostly coursework and a thesis or research paper in applied engineering. Another variant is the Academic Masters, which is equivalent to a Master of Science. Such degree is tied to more extensive research and is usually the choice of those who wish to continue on a doctoral course or work in academia.
        
        Canada
        In Canada, the Master of Engineering degree is a graduate degree typically one to two years in length that involves coursework and/or a major project. Some Canadian universities offer a Master of Engineering or either a Master of Science or Master of Applied Science in engineering. MEng degrees can be completed full-time or part-time.
        
        Colombia
        In Colombia, the Master of Engineering, which takes a minimum of two years, is a postgraduate program that follows the undergraduate of five years. Depending upon the emphasis is called Ms.Eng. with emphasis in Energy, Chemistry, Environment and so on. At the end, it is required to make a publication of the developed work in a recognized journal of scientific spreading as a requirement for the degree.
        
        Croatia
        Introduced with the Bologna process, the Croatian Master of Engineering is typically a two-year program and a direct continuation of a three-year Bachelor course. The degree is abbreviated mag. ing. and followed by the field of study (for example: mag. ing. računarstva – Master of Computer Engineering)
        
        Denmark
        From a Danish university, a Master of Science in Engineering is called cand.polyt (lat.: candidatus polytechnices). It is a two-year add-on to either an academic 3-year Bachelor in Engineering or a practical 3.5-year Profession Bachelor of Engineering. The title M.Sc. in Engineering is achievable from the following universities: the Technical University of Denmark, Aarhus University, Aalborg University, and the University of Southern Denmark.[citation needed] Just like in most European universities, a "Master of Engineering" degree does not exist in Denmark.
        
        Finland
        There are two distinct degrees in Finland, a taught university degree (diplomi-insinööri) and a polytechnic master's degree's (insinööri (ylempi AMK)).[3] While the former is translated as "Master of Science in Technology", the term "Master of Engineering" is predominantly used by Universities of Applied Sciences, which offer master's degree programs to holders of polytechnic bachelor's degrees (insinööri (amk)). As European Bologna process directs, in order to get an M.Eng. degree, B.Sc. engineers have to additionally study full-time one or two years and finalize a Master's thesis. Most of the M.Eng. degree programs are taught in Finnish, but some Swedish and English language programs also exist.[4]
        
        France
        In France, three diploma exist for 5 years of study in the field of engineering: the Master's diploma in engineering (diplôme de master en sciences de l'ingénieur) which is usually delivered by universities; the CMI for Cursus Master en Ingénierie (Comprehensive Master of Engineering), which is a selective master for a specific speciality with more courses than a normal master's diploma in engineering, that is delivered by universities selected by the label "Réseau figure" ; and the engineer's degree ("diplôme d'ingénieur") which can only be delivered by some Engineering schools called grandes écoles—very selective schools that are generally smaller than universities—and provides "a level of education comparable to a master's degree in engineering in the United States" (AACRAO).
        
        The engineer's degree usually prepare students for professional careers. Courses always include management, economy or more generally transverse courses. Training periods in industry or in laboratories are also required. The Master's diploma in engineering offers a more focused approach on a field of engineering, and the Comprehensive Master of Engineering is the elitist Master's program. A Ph.D. program can be joined by acquiring anyone of those three diplomas.
        
        Germany
        In Germany, the local engineer's degrees (Diplomingenieur (Dipl.-Ing.), a first degree after five years of study at a university and Dipl.-Ing. (FH), the engineering degree offered by Fachhochschulen after four years of study) were abolished in most universities and "Fachhochschulen" in 2010 and were replaced by postgraduate master's degrees (M.Sc. and M.Eng.).
        
        The first Master of Engineering courses were introduced in Germany in 2000 as result of the Bologna process. This type of master's degree is usually offered by Fachhochschulen (Universities of Applied Sciences) and a few smaller German universities[5] and is typically a two-year program (fachhochschulen and universities) with application-oriented coursework and an applied or research thesis.
        
        The entry requirement is the successful completion of a bachelor's degree or an equivalent from before the Bologna process, with good marks.
        
        The nine leading German technical universities (Group of TU9), like most European universities of technology, prefer awarding the Master of Science degree for completing engineering science studies in a master's program.[6]
        
        India
        In India, a Master of Engineering (M.E.) or a Master of Technology (M.Tech.) or a Master of Science in Engineering (MSc.Engg.) degree is a postgraduate program in engineering field. It is generally a 2-year program (2 or more years in case of MSc.Engg.) after completing a 4-year undergraduate degree in engineering (Bachelor of Engineering – B.E. or Bachelor of Technology – B.Tech.). Integrated M.E./M.Tech. degree (B.E./B.Tech. + M.E./M.Tech.) program of 5-year duration is also offered by many institutions.
        
        A Master of Science in Engineering (MSc.Engg.) is usually structured as a research master's degree, lesser than a PhD and considered to be parallel to an M.Phil. in humanities and science.
        
        Italy
        In Italy, the local engineer's degrees (Laurea in Ingegneria), a first degree after 5 years of study at a university were abolished in most universities in 2008. The equivalent of a Master of Engineering degree is a professional master's degree (Laurea Magistrale) of two years length that involves mostly coursework and a thesis paper in applied engineering. Entry requirements to a Master of Engineering degree include a 3-year bachelor engineering degree (Laurea).
        
        New Zealand
        In New Zealand, the Master of Engineering degree is generally a research based degree requiring completion of a thesis in key universities (University of Auckland, University of Canterbury, etc.).[7][8] Similar to the UK's Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) in engineering or technology, it is considered a lesser degree than Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and a higher degree than a coursework master. It is not to be confused with Master of Engineering Studies which is coursework master's degree.
        
        In Auckland University of Technology (AUT), this degree can be achieved either by completing a thesis (research pathway) or a combination of coursework and research project (coursework pathway).[9]
        
        Nepal
        In Nepal, a Master of Engineering (M.E.) or a Master of Technology (M.Tech.) degree is a postgraduate program in engineering. This is generally a 2-year specialization program in a specific branch of engineering field. Students typically enter the M.E./M.Tech. program after completing a 4-year undergraduate program in engineering resulting in the award of a Bachelor of Engineering or Bachelor of Technology degree. Kathmandu University, Tribhuwan University, Pokhara University and Purbanchal University offer this degree.
        
        Japan
        In Japan, the master of engineering (工学修士, Kogaku Shushi), which takes a minimum of two years, is a postgraduate program that follows the undergraduate of four years. It is a research degree between the bachelor's degree and the doctor's degree and requires completion of a thesis.
        
        Singapore
        In Singapore, the Master of Engineering is a research-based postgraduate program that typically lasts 2 to 3 years including coursework and must be completed by a comprehensive thesis evaluated by an examination committee. It is generally awarded as a pre-doctoral qualification in the field of engineering. This is in contrast to the "master of science" programs in engineering which are coursework-based and do not require a research thesis.
        
        South Korea
        In South Korea, the Master of Engineering, which takes a minimum of two years, is a postgraduate program that follows the undergraduate of four years. It is commonly awarded for specializations in the field of engineering rather than the science. For example, the degree "master of science in computer science" differs from the degree "master of engineering in computer science" in that the latter one is mainly concentrated on the applicability of the design with strong relation with the hardware rather than the software. Generally, the Master of Engineering program includes both coursework and research.
        
        Poland
        Magister inżynier (mgr inż., literally: master engineer) academic degree that can be obtained after 2 years post-graduate education (for students having already B.Eng.—inż.) or formerly (until full adaptation of Bologna process by university) through integrated 5 years B.Eng.–M.Eng. (or B.Sc.–M.Sc.) program, giving double degree mgr inż.
        
        Slovakia
        FIIT STU Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) accreditation[10] for two master's degree study programs: Intelligent Software Systems (combined fields of study Software Engineering – major and Artificial Intelligence – secondary) and Internet Technologies (in the field of study Computing Engineering); three bachelor's degree study programs and two doctoral degree study programs.[11]

        Spain
        Before the introduction of the Bologna Process, there were two different Spanish Engineering degrees: "Ingeniería", which took 5 or in some cases 6 full-time yearly courses; and "Ingeniería Técnica", of a shorter duration: 3 years or in some cases 4 full-time yearly courses.
        
        In the wake of the Bologna Process, the Spanish Educational System implanted the "Máster Habilitante en Ingeniería" and the "Máster Universitario en Ingeniería" degrees (Postgraduate Studies), which use the ECTS system designed by the European Union. They are slightly shorter to the second half of the former Engineering ("Ingeniería") academic degree, whereas the technical engineering degree is approximately similar to the bachelor's degree within the Bologna system.
        
        Education in Engineering in Spain had traditionally not too many specialties (Naval, Aerospatial, Industrial, Civil, Telecommunications, Informatics, among others) as in the past specialization was not so necessary but after Bologna the Degrees and Masters branched out numerously, giving birth to hundreds of different combinations, opening the possibility to do a bachelor's degree in one university and specialty and then to take a master's degree on another specialty, perhaps at a different university, having usually passed an individual interview by the dean and/or a "Propedeutics" exam or test of some sort, designed to guarantee a solid basis upon which to build further knowledge, that must take into consideration the relationship between the two branches of knowledge and among the subjects being taught at both degrees at the origin and the destination.
